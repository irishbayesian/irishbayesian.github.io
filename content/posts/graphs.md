For many reasons, we find ourselves in environments where the dissemination of knowledge is a process that is rushed. This hunger for information is, in a vacuum, quite a good sign! 

The downfall of this, however, is that often this rush leads to too many **layers of abstraction** for meaningful comment to be made. 

I will talk about graphs for this piece - but, importantly, this is not to slate them as a means of displaying and sharing information - as a statistics grad, they are close to my heart. What we must acknowledge in the era where many can open up excel and see a relationship between two columns, is that there are often many more dimensions to what we are discussing than the two we see in our plot.

We need to examine what *type* of data is being displayed to assess how useful our display is.

Many would be familiar with [qualitative and quantitative data](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/difference-between-quantitative-and-qualitative-data/) as groupings - and these are indeed useful for those processing information, but do little to help us process what is going on when we are presented with a graph.
